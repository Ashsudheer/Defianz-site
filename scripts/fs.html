                        Formula Student is Europeâ€™s most established educational engineering competition which uses motorsport to inspire students
                        Backed by industry and high-profile engineers such as Patron, Ross Brawn OBE, 
                        the competition aims to develop enterprising and innovative young engineers and encourage more young people to take
                        up a career in engineering. The format provides an ideal opportunity for students to demonstrate their engineering 
                        knowledge and test and improve their capabilities to deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment
                        of a motorsport competition.
                        
                        All students taking part get a chance to demonstrate their technical analysis, engineering design and manufacturing skills
                        whilst having to meet a strict deadline. Learning lessons along the way in team work, time management, project management,
                        budgeting and presentation. This will give them experience in the skills prospective employers will be looking for and setting
                        them up for a career in engineering.
